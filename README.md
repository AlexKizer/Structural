structural-core
==========

The core library for the Structural web app. Allows you to create components with animated views that represent data structures, and write code for these structures that executes asynchronously. Specifically, structural-core lets you:
* Create components with animated views.
* Wrap the methods of these components with a deferred execution context which lets you animate the code you write.
* Use or extend a set of standard, already-coded data structures.

### Bundled Data Structures

* array
* binary search tree (with AVL variant)
* binary heap
* stack/queue

### How to Build

Build with `grunt`.
